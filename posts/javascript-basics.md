# Getting Started with JavaScript

JavaScript is the language that powers the modern web. Whether you're building interactive websites, mobile apps, or even server-side applications, JavaScript is an essential skill for any developer.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** that was originally created to make web pages interactive. Today, it's used everywhere from browsers to servers to mobile applications.

## Your First JavaScript Code

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" example:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## Variables and Data Types

JavaScript has several built-in data types:

- **Numbers**: `let age = 25;`
- **Strings**: `let name = "Alice";`
- **Booleans**: `let isActive = true;`
- **Arrays**: `let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];`
- **Objects**: `let person = { name: "Bob", age: 30 };`

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Next Steps

This is just the beginning! JavaScript has much more to offer including:

- Event handling
- DOM manipulation  
- Asynchronous programming
- Modern ES6+ features
